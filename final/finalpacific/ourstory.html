            <h2>Our Story</h2>
             <p>
               <span class="resort">Pacific Trails Resort</span> was founded by two sisters, Emily and Maya who shared a love for hiking and exploring the outdoors. Growing up, they spent every free weekend on the trails, surrounded by mountains, trees, and the quiet sound of nature. But one thing always made their trips difficult finding a comfortable place to stay close to the hiking areas. That challenge inspired them to create Pacific Trails Resort, a place where visitors could enjoy nature without giving up comfort. They wanted to build a peaceful retreat where guests could wake up near the trails, breathe in fresh ocean air, and unwind after a long day of adventure. What started as a small idea between two sisters became a dream come true! A resort made for those who love the outdoors and want to reconnect with the beauty of nature.

            <h2>Our Values</h2>
             <p>
            At Pacific Trails Resort, we value peace, connection, and respect for nature. We believe time outdoors can restore balance, and were committed to keeping our surroundings clean and sustainable. Whether its a quiet morning walk or a shared campfire under the stars, every moment here is about slowing down and feeling close to the world around you.
